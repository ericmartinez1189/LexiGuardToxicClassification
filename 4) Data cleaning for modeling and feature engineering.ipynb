       "123    A new regime is need for flood risk insurance - in Canada, insurers are now selling overland flood insurance (separate from common sewer pipe back-up) available in areas of small local overland flow, beyond valleys. That new Canadian coverage (Intact, Aviva, RSA ...) is not available in high risk floodplains though. So highest risk are not insurable. The key problem in Canada is a fragmented insurance market with some insurers holding a couple percentages of the property and casualty market, making it uneconomical or impractical to invest in proper risk models for complex phenomena : valley riverine, urban overland, and sewer back-up risk are sometimes interrelated during extreme events as shown in a review of last 3 Toronto storms exploring risk factors holistically \"from flood plain to floor drain\":\\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/RobertMuir3/urban-flood-risk-from-flood-plains-to-floor-drains\\nNew floodplain maps alone will not improve understanding of the highest risk urban flood risks.\n",

He has no competence in this area and should not \\nlend credibility to what is essentially a prudential matter.  \\n\\nThere is nothing wrong with Trump's approach to Russia, and there is no reason for the Catholic Church at this time and under current current circumstances to advise anyone, let alone the President on the matter. Again this is a prudential matter. \\n\\nRelations between nations have nothing to do with what a country has done in terms of \"Suppressing democracy\".

He never once on Facebook, Twitter or texting said he hated gays.

Did anybody note the big loophole in Trump's declaration?..........use US products \"to the maximum extent possible\". This is a loophole large enough to run 3,000km of large diameter pipe through. TRP could play with the specs of the Keystone pipe so as to make most US suppliers ineligible. Not so many US manufacturers have the capability to produce 48\" heavy wall tubes. US Steel, for example, does not have that capability. Grade of steel could be another sticking point.\\n\\nThe coating part of the contract would also be problematic for US companies. There is no company in USA that has a coating plant with the capabilities of Shawcor's newer plant in Camrose, AB; a plant that is just across the street from the 48\" pipe forming mill owned by Evraz Camrose.\\n\\nFor all of his self-declared expertise at negotiating business deals, I think that Trump may be not quite so adept as he thinks.\n",

The vocation crisis is not about women, just as it is not about men.  It is about letting go of a patriarchal culture that is passing away, and allowing the Lord to call those he wants here and now, men and women, to all vocations, including the sacramental priesthood and the episcopate, without imposing artificial gender walls that are heritage from the Old Law (not the New Law!) and no longer make sense.  The sacramental priesthood is about service, not genitals. Ordained priests do #2 sitting down.  Why in the world is it that they cannot do #1 sitting down as well?  Allow the Lord to call women to the ministerial priesthood, and the life of the Church will be much better!\n",
       "3               Climate change, in the sense discussed in the Pope's encyclical, is a dubious theory at best. Also,  your claim that 95% of the \"scientific community\" supports the theory is  patently false. In any event for a pope to give his imprimatur to a scientific theory is unprecedented.   He has no competence in this area and should not  lend credibility to what is essentially a prudential matter.    There is nothing wrong with Trump's approach to Russia, and there is no reason for the Catholic Church at this time and under current current circumstances to advise anyone, let alone the President on the matter. Again this is a prudential matter.   Relations between nations have nothing to do with what a country has done in terms of \"Suppressing democracy\". What planet do you live on.   As for as poverty is concerned, the Pope should speak out against the corrupt governments that keep people in poverty and ignorance. Thinking that America can pay to save the world misses the point.\n",
       "9                        There will be some hand wringing about sourcing steel for Keystone from US sources. Did anybody note the big loophole in Trump's declaration?..........use US products \"to the maximum extent possible\". This is a loophole large enough to run 3,000km of large diameter pipe through. TRP could play with the specs of the Keystone pipe so as to make most US suppliers ineligible. Not so many US manufacturers have the capability to produce 48\" heavy wall tubes. US Steel, for example, does not have that capability. Grade of steel could be another sticking point.  The coating part of the contract would also be problematic for US companies. There is no company in USA that has a coating plant with the capabilities of Shawcor's newer plant in Camrose, AB; a plant that is just across the street from the 48\" pipe forming mill owned by Evraz Camrose.  For all of his self-declared expertise at negotiating business deals, I think that Trump may be not quite so adept as he thinks.\n",

       "15    To be honest, HB 2004 will help a few tenants in the short term.  But, in the long run, it will make life more difficult for a lot of good tenants and give additional cover to some bad actors.   It will remove any incentive for landlords to give people with a tarnished past a second chance, and it will increase the cost of housing, because everytime a landlord hires an attorney, tenants ultimately pay for it, or the landlord goes out of business.   All the while doing nothing to alleviate the housing supply problem.  Legislators need to look at the  Craigslist Housing Wanted section.  They would see that tenants want more flexibility in the ability to rent what are now sub standard, illegal spaces.  A temporary moratorium on local restrictive codes would quickly assist with the supply problem until more units can be built.  This is truly the word on the street from tenants......not the public employee union financed opinions put forth by CAT, PTU and Stable Homes Oregon FB pages.\n",

I was attacked for saying Orlando was an Islamist terrorist attack. I was told it had nothing to do with Islam. It was a hate-crime against gays and LGBT people, they said.  Well, the fact is the terrorist posted on his own Facebook, put it on Twitter, and said it in text messages on his own phone that his assault on the nightclub was SUPPORT FOR ISIS. He never once on Facebook, Twitter or texting said he hated gays. The fact he chose the nightclub for his attack was, in all likelihood, because he knew the nightclub inside and out: the doors, windows, exits, etc. And he knew there would be a lot of people to kill there.  The terrorist declared his support for ISIS and never once mentioned gays. However the regressive-left 'liberals' refused to accept the facts.\n",

The vocation crisis is not about women, just as it is not about men. It is about letting go of a patriarchal culture that is passing away, and allowing the Lord to call those he wants here and now, men and women, to all vocations, including the sacramental priesthood and the episcopate, without imposing artificial gender walls that are heritage from the Old Law (not the New Law!) and no longer make sense. The sacramental priesthood is about service, not genitals. Ordained priests do # sitting down. Why in the world is it that they cannot do # sitting down as well? Allow the Lord to call women to the ministerial priesthood, and the life of the Church will be much better!   \n",
       "3  Climate change, in the sense discussed in the Pope's encyclical, is a dubious theory at best. Also, your claim that % of the \"scientific community\" supports the theory is patently false. In any event for a pope to give his imprimatur to a scientific theory is unprecedented. He has no competence in this area and should not lend credibility to what is essentially a prudential matter. There is nothing wrong with Trump's approach to Russia, and there is no reason for the Catholic Church at this time and under current current circumstances to advise anyone, let alone the President on the matter. Again this is a prudential matter. Relations between nations have nothing to do with what a country has done in terms of \"Suppressing democracy\". What planet do you live on. As for as poverty is concerned, the Pope should speak out against the corrupt governments that keep people in poverty and ignorance. Thinking that America can pay to save the world misses the point.   \n",

The vocation crisis is not about women, just as it is not about men. It is about letting go of a patriarchal culture that is passing away, and allowing the Lord to call those he wants here and now, men and women, to all vocations, including the sacramental priesthood and the episcopate, without imposing artificial gender walls that are heritage from the Old Law (not the New Law!) and no longer make sense. The sacramental priesthood is about service, not genitals. Ordained priests do # sitting down. Why in the world is it that they cannot do # sitting down as well? Allow the Lord to call women to the ministerial priesthood, and the life of the Church will be much better!   \n",
       "3  Climate change, in the sense discussed in the Pope's encyclical, is a dubious theory at best. Also, your claim that % of the \"scientific community\" supports the theory is patently false. In any event for a pope to give his imprimatur to a scientific theory is unprecedented. He has no competence in this area and should not lend credibility to what is essentially a prudential matter. There is nothing wrong with Trump's approach to Russia, and there is no reason for the Catholic Church at this time and under current current circumstances to advise anyone, let alone the President on the matter. Again this is a prudential matter. Relations between nations have nothing to do with what a country has done in terms of \"Suppressing democracy\". What planet do you live on. As for as poverty is concerned, the Pope should speak out against the corrupt governments that keep people in poverty and ignorance.
